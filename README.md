# PandaFPS
A fps type game made in Panda3D

# System Requirements
A Windows PC (XP+)
Panda3D installed properly (the PIP version)
The models (will be avalible soon via mega.nz)

# About
This is a simple FPS controller made by a one-person development studio. Raycast bullets/advanced object collision will be added soon!

# How to install
You need the latest version of Panda3D from the official website. The PIP version was used in development so it is reccomended that you use that. As Panda3D is bundled with a special version of Python with PATH requirements satisfied, you only need Python for downloading with PIP. Place the models (available via mega.nz) directly into the root of your "C:" drive. Run the game via CMD with "python test.py" (without the quotations). The game will automatically start.

# More
This movement controller is most likely very buggy. Please report bugs in the issues tab.
When the game starts you may notice significant frame drops/skips. This is COMPLETELY normal and is because of PyAutoGUI (which manages the cursor) callibrating its clock and active times with that of Panda3D.
