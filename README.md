# System Requirements
A Windows PC (XP+)
Any Linux distribution that support the Panda3D SDK
Panda3D installed properly (the PIP version)
Python3 with PIP


# About
This is a simple FPS controller made by a one-person development studio. Raycast bullets/advanced object collision will be added soon!

# How to install
You need the latest version of Panda3D from the official website. The PIP version was used in development so it is reccomended that you use that. As Panda3D is bundled with a special version of Python with PATH requirements satisfied, you only need Python for downloading with PIP. To insert your models into the game, add your .BAM files into the models folder of your Panda3D installation. You may add your music into the music folder (see the music path in the code).
# More
This movement controller has some problems with framerate drops (due to models with an in-efficient amount of meshes. If you find some way to improve this movement controller please create a push request and I will review and put your code into the main branch.

# Buy me a coffee!
Being a developer is hard work and requires a lot of time. Supporting me on Patreon really means a lot and will also allow me to release more updates/bugfixes to this project.
