# PandaFPS
An FPS controller made in Panda3D

# DEPRECEATED AND UNSUPPORTED!
I made this a long time ago, before I really even knew how Panda3d worked. Now, looking at my code I realize how bad it is. You really shouldn't use this and there are probably many much better examples out there. Sometime in the future I will fix this (possibly).
